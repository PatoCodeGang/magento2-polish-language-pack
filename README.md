## Why This Language Pack?

Ever tried using Google Translate for your Polish Magento store? Yeah, we've been there - it's like asking a cat to bark. That's why we crafted this language pack with actual humans who speak Polish (and know their e-commerce!).

Unlike other language packs that often leave you with partial translations, our pack is 100% complete - from product pages to checkout, from customer emails to admin panels. No more mixed-language experiences that confuse your customers.

### What Makes This Pack Special?

- 🎯 **Native-level Translations**: No more "Add to Shopping Basket" when you mean "Dodaj do koszyka". We've got the nuances covered.
- 🛍️ **E-commerce Focused**: Translation is an art - especially when it comes to converting visitors into customers. Each phrase is crafted with Polish shopping behaviors in mind.
- 🔍 **SEO-friendly**: Polish search terms and metadata that actually make sense to both users and search engines.
- 🎨 **Frontend & Backend**: Complete translations for both your customers and admin team.
- 💯 **Fully Translated**: Every single string is translated. No gaps, no surprises.

## Installation

```bash
composer require patocode/magento2-polish-language-pack:dev-main

php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy pl_PL -f
php bin/magento cache:flush
```

## Real Talk

Let's be honest - most language packs feel like they were translated by someone who's never actually used Magento. We've been building Magento stores since version 1.x, and this language pack is the result of countless hours of real-world Polish e-commerce experience.
